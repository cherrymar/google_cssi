# Rock Paper Scissors

## Background

Here we will recreate the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors using functions!  Functions will break our program down into easily understood parts.  Your task is to use the given functions to build the game.

## Task

Choose your level based on difficulty:

* Level 1 - game functions are defined for you - your goal is to put those functions together to create a working game of RPS
* Level 2 - only some game functions are defined - your goal is to complete the other functions, then use them to create a working game of RPS
* Level 3 - all game functions are outlined, but no code is written - your goal is to write all the functions yourself according to the specifications, and then put them all together to create a working game of RPS.

The game of Rock Paper Scissors should work by:

* Asking the user how many rounds they want to play
* Use a loop to play each round, keeping track of score
* Print the scoreboard at the end of each round
* Print the overall winner at the end of all the rounds

## Extensions

### Level 2

This will be similar to level 1, except we only define a few of the functions for you.  You'll have to write the code for the other functions (we provide the specifications), then you combine them to create a working game of RPS.

### Level 3

Now we don't give you any code - only specifications - and you have to write the functions, then put them together at the end to create the game of RPS.
