### Your local technology store has hired you to create their website for them.

All of the images you see in the mockups are located in the images folder. Your job is to recreate the website pieces you see below, and combine them to make a cohesive site. Use your knowledge of HTML and CSS to make your client happy!

### Navigation Bar
Almost every website you look at will have a navigation bar at the top of the page, this is a great way to allow users to navigate your site. Recreate the basic example below using what you just practiced in the CSS flexbox lab. The fonts used in the gif below are from google fonts. Feel free to use whatever fonts you think are the most aesthetic.

### Cards, Part A
Replicate the card that you see below. You'll want to include an image, article title and author name. Think logically, will you want this card above or below your navigation bar? Try to stay away from using pixels to size things, percentages will keep your page responsive to the page size.

### Cards, Part B
Populate your page more, add in 1 or 2 more cards, these will serve as your "Top Stories".

You know what they say, if they love something, set it free! Build out the rest of this site with more tech news stories. Check out the gif below of the website "The Verge" for inspiration.

  <ul>
    <li>Look at the mockups above and figure out which areas are their own divs, draw out a basic wireframe on a piece of paper.</li>
    <li>Start creating the general areas(divs) that your page will need. Without filling them with content, color the backgrounds in order to create the general look that you're going for.</li>
    <li>Choose one section at a time to recreate, fill in all of the content and html you'll need, then style it until you're happy with the result.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

Once you've got the look down work on making your website more responsive. This means that as the size of your window shrinks or grows, your website should remain usable and nice to look at.

### Extension
You may have noticed that when you make your page **reaaaaaaaaaally** small, your cards get too small to look good. We can fix this problem by using the min-height and min-width CSS properties. Go into your style.css page and use these properties to set a minimum size for your cards. You'll notice that this won't impact the size of your cards when the page is big, but will make sure that they don't get too small.
