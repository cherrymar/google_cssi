### Ready to grind out some grid-full page formats?

## Background
You've been asked to create a family scrapbook for your Parent's upcoming birthday. With your knowledge of CS, you decide to bring scrapbooks into the modern age and digitize the process.

## Task
You'll be given several page formats and asked to recreate them. We'll use divs labeled with the content that will fill them, for example "Photo", "Caption", "Title". Once your finished, feel free to replace these with actual content.

This [link](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) might be helpful as you work through the lab.

1. Format One:
You'll recreate the format below in the format_one.html and format_one.css files. You may notice that there is already some styling done for you in basic.css. For now, ignore this as it isn't related to the css grid skills that we're practicing.

2. Format Two:
Recreate this format in the format_two.css and format_two.html. You'll need to use the span property to get all of the columns looking the way you want them to. In order to have your page border look correct you'll need to span in both the column and row direction.

  Now that you've used your css grid skills to make this look nice, take a look at the basic.css. Meander your eyes on down to line 4 and **shocker**, what do we see?

  *display: flex;*

  No doubt, you feel betrayed right now. "But I thought this was a css grid lab??". Yes, it is, but the real benefit of these things come when they are used **together**. Often, flexbox will be the easier choice when styling individual elements and trying to align content, while css-grid will allow you to easily create bigger picture page formats. Parse through the basic.css code and try to understand the gist of what is going on.

3. Format Three:
Watch the behavior of the mockup below as you expand the width of the page. Check out the auto-fill vs auto-fit and minmax properties to achieve this effect. Remember, all of the rows should be 100px, no matter how many rows you end up with.

4. Format Four: Putting it all together
This will be a messages page, where family members can write happy birthday messages and sign the scrap book. However, some family members have requested more space for writing.

  You've been given a general format in the format_four.html and format_four.css files. You'll need to replace the large "messages" block with 15 or more individual message blocks. The class of each box should signify which kind of family member has written the box.

  * **Siblings:** Span 2 columns, but one row
  * **Aunts and Uncles:** Span 1 column, but two rows
  * **Grandparents:** Span 2 columns and two rows
  * **Cousins and friends:** One row, and one column

## Extension
Look back at the extension in the museum-manager flexbox lab. Try to recreate the same(or a different) Mondrian using css grid instead. Think about which one you thought was easier to use and what aspects of the features were more and less helpful.
