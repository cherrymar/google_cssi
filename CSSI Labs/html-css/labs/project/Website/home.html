          <div><p class="text">Jayrald is super cute, especially when he eats strawberries.
            To see Jayrald eating a strawberry, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUV56U-lfPg">video.</a>
            He was an internet sensation when he was just a child. But don't think for a minute this changed his character.
            He stays true to his principles. Be a good citizen and don't skip meals. (Because come on, food is important)
