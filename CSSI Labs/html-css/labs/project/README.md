Remember that save the polar bear website you always wanted to make? Or the dating profile you've always thought your dog needed? Now is the time to bring your ideas to life. Choose one of the themes below and then check out the general steps provided at the end of the lab. Get ready to see where the magic of html and CSS can take you...

## Feeling *Funny*?
Online dating is all the **rage** these days, and in my opinion, our pets deserve love just as much as we do.
Don't have a pet? Make one up! Chanel your inner spirit animal and get to work! You should have a section describing your pet. This can be anything from their physical description, to their entire backstory. You should also include a section on what your pet is looking for in a partner, and a section that explains what led them to take their chances on petHarmony.

## Feeling *Passionate*?
Make an information website that will teach people about a cause that you're passionate about. Include a section that explains the background/history of the issue, a section that explains WHY this is important to you, and a section that tells the person looking at your website how they can get involved.

## Feeling *Useful*?
Think of something that you know how to do **really** well and create a website that teaches other people your secret skill. This can be anything from juggling to making candy sushi. Your website should have section describing your experience with what you're teaching, a section that tells your viewer **why** they should want to learn this skill, and finally, a tutorial.
