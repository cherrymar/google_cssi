You've been given some HTML, CSS and JS code to get you started. Open up a live preview of your HTML page. You should see three buttons and a large box. Open up inspect on your live preview so that you can see the **JavaScript console** on the page. Now try clicking on the red button? What happens?

You should see "You clicked the red button!" printed to your terminal.

### Task
1. Now that you've seen what happens when you click on the red button, add code to your script.js file to make sure that your green and blue buttons are just as interactive. When you click on the green button it should say "You clicked on the green button!" and when you click on the blue button it should say "You clicked on the blue button!".
2. Next, let's make that plain empty box look a little bit cooler. Write code in your script.js file that accomplishes the following:
  * When you click on the red button, the box should turn red.
  * When you click on the blue button, the box should turn blue.
  * When you click on the green button, the box should turn green.
3. Now that you have the box changing color, let's add some more. Each time you click on one of the buttons, the name of it's color should be displayed in the box. For example, when you click on the red button, the word "red" should appear in the box.

### Extension
* Instead of replacing the text inside of the box each time you click on the button, add to it. For example, if I click the red button, then the green button, then the blue button, my end result would be "red green blue" displayed inside my box.
* Add another button that will clear all of the color and words from inside of the box.
