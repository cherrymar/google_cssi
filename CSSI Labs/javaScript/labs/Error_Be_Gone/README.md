#### Introduction
Now that you've written some javaScript and become comfortable with the language, you've decided to try to make some money by correcting other people's code. You offer two services:
1. Debugging
  * In these cases you help people locate errors in their code. If this code does run, it will likely return incorrect answers. Look for syntax errors, like a missing parentheses or using the wrong number of equal signs, as well as gaps in logic that might be resulting in an incorrect output.

2. Style Correction
  * This kind of code will compile and run correctly, but will be extremely hard to read. Use the google style guide to ensure that the code's style is as solid as the logic behind it.

#### Tasks
Complete the tasks below and successfully correct all of the broken code you've been given. Before you get started, check out the tips and tricks for debugging below! In order to get started open up a live preview of the html file. The page is empty, but if you check out the console, you'll see that the code from debu1.js is running.

  <ul>
    <li>Error messages are your friend here, run the code as many times as you need to see where your errors are.</li>
    <li>Debug in chunks! At the end of each file is a section commented "Test Functions". Comment out all function calls except for one so you can debug a single function at a time. This will make your job **much** easier.</li>
    <li>Print statements are also extremely helpful when debugging. Place console.logs throughout your code to see what variables are holding what and how var your code is getting before it stops running.</li>
    <li>Be conscious of data types as well as what values certain built in functions actually return</li>
    <li>No code is safe, don't assume that the code underneath the //Test Functions comment is correct...</li>
  </ul>

You'll know that you've correctly found and squashed all bugs once you can run these files and get the correct output. Remember, you run the code by entering "node filename.js" into your terminal.

1. Begin by opening up your debug1.js file. You can run this by typing node debug1.js in your terminal. You'll notice that when you run this code you get some errors. This is because this code is broken! It's your job to fix all of the errors throughout the code. Look through each function using error messages and placing print statements if you need them in order to debug the code. You'll know you're finished when your code runs successfully.

2. Now that you've warmed up your debugging skills, it's time to work through debug2.js. Go into the index.html file and comment out the first script tag. Uncomment the line that links debug2.js on line 10. Now when you open up the html page debug2.js will be running in the console.

3. Now that you've learned how to make sure your code works, it's time to learn how to make code readable. Ugly code is hard to understand, which makes it difficult to work with other people when you're coding. Open up your index.html file again and uncomment the style.js script tag. Make sure all other script tags are commented out. Open up the file style.js. If you run the code(it will run automatically when you refresh the html page and check out the console), you'll see that it works. I know, I was shocked too. Use the google style guide to fix this code. The file, answers.jpg contain an image of the final code you should see. Do your best to work through the file without looking at the answers, but feel free to use the image to check your work once you've finished.

#### Extension
Ready to really challenge your debugging skills? Open up debugExtreme.js and get the code working! Make sure to have the correct script tag uncommented in your html file! Feel free to work with another partner that has finished all the tasks. This code is **hard**, so enjoy the struggle and take your time walking through each section of code!
