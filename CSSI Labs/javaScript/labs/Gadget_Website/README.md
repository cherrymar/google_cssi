Now that you've had time to practice DOM and really test your JavaScript skills, it's time to apply it all. In this project you'll need to pull on your HTML and CSS skills, as well as your JavaScript knowledge. Give yourself a few minutes of googling and find the coolest gadget that you can. Personally I think this Star Wars Darth Vader Toaster is **perfect**. [Click here to see what I mean.](https://awesomestufftobuy.com/star-wars-darth-vader-toaster/) You'll be creating a website about your gadget and the magic that it will bring to your life. Then you'll be animating your boring static website, with lots of fun DOM.
#### Tasks
Before we jump into our core tasks, there's two **very** important checks that you should always do when creating a new website. The first is making sure that your CSS file is linked to your HTML file and the second is ensuring that your javaScript file is linked to your HTML file. Without proper linking, you can have all the code in the world, but nothing will happen!

* **CSS Link Check**

  Start by putting something into your HTML to style. Write a quick H1 tag that says "Welcome to my website". Now go into your CSS file and make the color of your H1 text red. If this works, then you know that your CSS and HTML files are properly linked.

* **JavaScript Link Check**

  Write a console.log statement at the top of your javaScript file. When you open up your website, use the inspector to make sure that statement is printed to the console.

Finally, let's get down to business.
1. Create your website. The elements listed below are minimum requirements, meaning you can have more, but must have at least the following things:
  * 3 Images
  * H1 page title
  * 2 subsections with titles (H2)
  * At least one paragraph per subsection (p)
  * 2 links
  * 3 Divs

        Make sure that you create a wireframe for your website before you actually build it. Your subsections can be whatever you want. Some ideas are: A description of the gadget, Why you need this gadget in your life, What you think should be added to the gadget to make it even cooler, or Similar gadgets that you have found online. Get creative, and let your inner designer come out.
2. This should be the focus of your attention, it's time to add some interactivity to your page. This means that you should now be moving into your script.js file. Remember that you'll need to grab objects from your HTML using query selectors, add event listeners and create functions. If you need your memory jogged, take a second to look back at your Color_Buttons, Magic-8-Ball and Gif_Finder labs. Add the following features to your page:
  * When you click on your title, change it to something *punny*.
  * If you click on your title again, it should switch back to your original title. (AKA make the title toggle between your original title and your pun each time you click it)
  * Have your links change color when your mouse is over them.
  * Pick your favorite Div, change the background color randomly each time you click on it.
  * When your mouse is over any of the images, add a border to it. When your mouse leaves the border should go away. You need this to work for all of your images, consider how using a named function could reduce the amount of code you need to copy.
  * If you click on one of the images, all of them should become circular. Think about how you can use this with the classList property.
  * When you click on the space bar, the entire page should be reset to it's original state.

#### Extension
Keep going! Add more interactivity, add buttons, add more elements, add more pages, add! The beauty of learning these skills is that you can now use them to make anything you want. Get creative and have fun with it.
