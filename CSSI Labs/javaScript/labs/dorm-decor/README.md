## Task
Preview the html and css page given, you should see several pictures of different types of potential dorm decorations. As you move through the lab you'll be using querySelector and console.log to print out the things you must have for your dorm room.

### Posters
Everyone wants their dorm to feel like home, your wall decor can play a huge role in that. Using the queryselector, create a variable that holds the poster you would want in your dorm room. Then use console.log to make sure you've selected the right poster. You should be working in the script.js file provided.

### Chairs
Who doesn't want to have the comfiest, coolest chair in the whole hall? Select the chair you want, and console.log the chair, the id of the chair you selected, and the list of classes assigned to that specific chair.

### Lighting
The right lighting will create unbeatable ~vibes~ in your dorm room. Format your selection nicely. Select the h3 that holds the Lighting header, and console.log the innerHTML of the h3. Then, print "I have selected the element: *insert element here*", "This element has the id *insert id* and the classes *insert class list*". Combine what you know about string interpolation and JavaScript to accomplish this.

## Congratulations! Your dorm is decorated!
